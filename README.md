# E2S
E2S (Electron to Sample) is a physical computer code for the full simulations from electrons generating synchrotron radiation to the final sample plane.
In this repository, the calculations of flux, intensity, partially coherent wavefront and power density have been included. The E2S-SRW and E2S-SHADOW optimisers are also included.
